## Description
A game of taboo where 5 players connect to the game server in multiple terminals. Every turn, one player is the designated "hinter" who has a list of taboo words they can't use to get the others to guess correctly within a minute. Each correct guesser receives a point and the hinter gets a point for every correct guesser. After ten rounds, the player with the most points wins and the game ends.

## To Start Game:
1. open 6 terminals
2. make and ./server in one
3. ./client in the other 5 (entering y and username as you go)
