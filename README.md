Taboo
Mandy Mai

A game of taboo where 5 players connect to the game server in multiple terminals. Every turn, one player is the designated "hinter" who has a list of taboo words they can't use to get the others to guess correctly within a minute. Each correct guesser receives a point and the hinter gets a point for every correct guesser. After ten rounds, the player with the most points wins and the game ends.

To Start Game:
open 6 terminals
make and ./server in one
./client in the other 5 (entering y and username as you go)
